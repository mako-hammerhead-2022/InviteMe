# InviteMe

## An event invitation and management application.

### Details
The host (user) is able to add and delete invitees in the Guestlist database, requiring only the invitee's name and email address. The host can then send an automated email invitation to the individual invitee by clicking the 'Send Invite' button.

The invitee is able to navigate to their personal RSVP profile by following the email link and then authenticating their email address.
The invitee is able to update their RSVP details and other information such as 'bring a plus one' and 'dietary restrictions'.

The host will receive the updated guest details, and can add their plus one to the overall Guestlist.
Finally, the host is able to drag and drop guests into different tables in the Seating Plan.
